# Advanced Excel Data Analysis: Car Dataset Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging **Excel's advanced functions** to analyze a dataset containing car details. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and apply various **data analysis techniques** using functions like **VLOOKUP, IF, AND, OR, FIND, RIGHT, LEN, and mathematical conversions**.

## 🔹 Key Features
- **VLOOKUP Integration:** Fetches columns such as fuel type, registration city, assembly, transmission, and condition from another sheet.
- **Selection Criteria Filtering:** Uses **IF, AND, OR, and NOT** functions to mark cars as "SELECTED" or "NOT SELECTED" based on conditions:
  - Fuel type is Petrol or CNG.
  - City is NOT Karachi.
  - Car make is NOT Toyota or Honda.
- **Model Extraction:** Extracts the model name from a "Make Model" column using **FIND, RIGHT, and LEN** functions.
- **Miles Per Year Calculation:** Converts **kilometers to miles**, then divides by the age of the car (difference between car year and 2024), rounding to **3 decimal places**.

## 📊 Data Analysis Questions Answered
✅ What is the **average price** of CNG models in Suzuki?  
✅ How many **local, automatic Honda models** exist in Lahore?  
✅ What is the **total price** of imported, manual cars in Karachi?  
✅ What is the **difference between the average price** of local and imported cars?  
✅ What is the **percentage of CNG cars** in the dataset?  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel** (VLOOKUP, IF, AND, OR, FIND, RIGHT, LEN, mathematical operations)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the Excel file.
2. Navigate through the dataset and formulas applied to extract insights.
3. Modify criteria if needed and apply formulas for custom analysis.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Automate the analysis using **Power Query**.
- Implement a **Pivot Table Dashboard** for dynamic insights.
- Extend functionality using **Python for data visualization**.
